# RomCom
## M1 Paired Project
### Contributors: Joshua Benefield & Anna Johnson

##### Welcome to our project!

With this app, you'll be able to peruse a myriad of RomCom book covers that are readily available for you. Come across a book that strikes your fancy? Utilize the 'Save Cover' button and come back to it later via the 'View Saved Covers' button! Don't see exactly what you're looking for? Not to worry! Simply make your own RomCom novel using the form that appears when you click 'Make Your Own Cover' and save it for others to enjoy!
