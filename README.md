# RomCom
## M1 Paired Project
### Contributors: Joshua Benefield & Anna Johnson

##### Welcome to our project!

With this app, you'll be able to peruse a myriad of RomCom book covers that are readily available for you. Come across a book that strikes your fancy? Utilize the 'Save Cover' button and come back to it later via the 'View Saved Covers' button! Don't see exactly what you're looking for? Not to worry! Simply make your own RomCom novel using the form that appears when you click 'Make Your Own Cover' and save it for others to enjoy!

##### Install Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. `cd` into the romcom directory.
3. `open index.html` in your terminal to open the app.
4. Have fun navigating around the app!

##### Future Iterations
If we worked on this project more in the future, we think it'd be cool to add the following:
* Code that allows you to zoom in on a cover.
* Code that keeps the same cover from being saved twice.
