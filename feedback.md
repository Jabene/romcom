Professionalism 
* 2
* I appreciate your ability to collaborate considering the obstacles you overcame!
* I elected not to score you against this particular bullet, because I know you were pairing “driver/navigator” style primarily.
    * There is no more than a 10% disparity in code contributions between teammates. Note: this is checked via the “Insights” and “Contributors” tab in your GitHub repo.
* There are only three branches - Ideally we would like to see a branch per feature you are adding to the project.
    * Branches are consistently used for individual features


JavaScript Style & Implementation
* 3
* Great naming conventions!
* Code is DRY and mostof your functions are SRP!
* There were a few bullet points that are keeping you from a 4.
* Conditionals are written in a way that demonstrates an understanding of truthy/falsy values. For example, the developer avoids using logic like === true and !== 0.
    * `if (savedCovers.includes()=== false)`
    * I am not exactly sure what this is checking for - I am guessing you wanted to check if the currentCover is in the savedCovers array - ex. `if(savedCovers.includes(currentCover) === false)`
      could be written `if (!savedCovers.includes(currentCover))`
* Really good job making the deleteCover functionality work!


Functional Expectations 
* 2.5
    * Before you merged that last change today - there was a bug that allowed a single cover to be saved multiple times. 
    * I gave you the extra half point because it works
